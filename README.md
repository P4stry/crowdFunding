# CharityDAO

## Description

CharityDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain that allows people to donate to a charity and vote on how the funds are used. The smart contract code is written in Solidity, and the web application interacts with the contract through Web3 and MetaMask.

# Features

Users can donate to the charity through the smart contract.

The contract keeps track of the total amount of funds raised and the number of contributors.

The contract manager can create requests for how the funds should be spent.

Contributors can vote on the requests.

When a request has received enough votes, the contract manager can release the funds to the recipient specified in the request.

# Installation
